## About me 

<img src="https://portfolio-thisispauline.vercel.app/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FprofilePicture.b95eb14f.png&w=750&q=75" width="auto" height="300" />

Born in Paris, Iâ€™ve lived in the sunny south of Spain for the past four years. Adapting to life in a foreign country has taught me valuable skills in resilience, adaptability, and cross-cultural communication. After five years in the publishing industry, I felt the urge to pursue a new challenge and decided to retrain as a Full Stack Web Developer at Wild Code School. I'm now eager to embark on the next phase of my career as a Frontend Developer, as my true passion lies in crafting visually stunning, pixel-perfect designs.
